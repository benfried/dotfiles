		     Dynamic Macro, version 2.1
		     ------- -----  ------- ---
Dynamic Macro is a program for inserting structured text in Emacs.  In
addition to straight textual substitution (already available through
Emacs' Abbrev mode) Dmacro will insert time- and date-stamps, your name
and user-id, the current file name, a file's contents, the results of a
shell command and anything else you can think of.  It can prompt the
user for strings.  It can also position the cursor within the expanded
text, and indent the expansion in whatever way is appropriate to the
current major mode.  Dmacro will also allow you to bind macros to keys
and automatically insert macros in new files.

A development team can use a common macro table with standardized
comment block and code macros as a way of enforcing a coding standard.

You can insert blocks of text like these:

   -------------------------------     -------------------------------
   NAME                                for (var = 0; var < p; ++var)
     myfile.c                          {
   NOTES                                 m
                                       } /* for */
   HISTORY

   -------------------------------     -------------------------------
   where the user, file and date       where "p" and "m" indicate the position
   info are automatically filled       of the point and mark, and "var" is
   in at insertion time.               supplied by the user in the minibuffer.

INSTALLATION
------------
Unpack Dmacro in a directory not on your load-path (to avoid confusion
during installation).  Change the two directory names at the top of
Makefile as appropriate, then from the shell prompt, type:

	make install

To prepare a hardcopy version of the user's manual type:

	make tree-killer

See dm-c.el for an idea of what to add to your ~/.emacs file.
